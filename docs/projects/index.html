Mostly.</p><p>This was also my first time working with C# outside of Unity and I quite like it. It also helps that it was really easy to pick up since its syntax is exceptionally similar to Java except for the Capitalization Of Everything. Working with Windows Forms was also very fun. There&#39;s something I can&#39;t really explain about the look of those default Windows dialog boxes that&#39;s somewhat nostalgic and just generally cool to work with; I get that same feeling with Java&#39;s Swing using the default look-and-feel. I don&#39;t know what it is. Maybe I&#39;m just weird like that. I definitely envision myself using C# for something else in the future.</p><p>I guess I should talk about the actual plugins, huh? Well there are a couple of really simple ones like one that selects everything after the playhead and one that adds a VEGAS Picture In Picture effect to everything (because yes, I wanted a script for that). The big and complex ones include a &quot;screen shake&quot; effect, a super janky &quot;chromatic aberration&quot; effect, and a plugin that can animate any parameter of a video effect based on an oscillator, random number generator, or noise.</p><p class="project-link"><a href="https://github.com/NitroGuy10/Vegas-Scripts#readme" rel="noopener noreferrer">VEGAS_Scripts on GitHub</a></p><!--]--></div></div><div id="nitroguy10.github.io" class="ProjectsEntry"><hr class="mb-8"><h3 class="font-bold text-3xl mb-5"><a href="#nitroguy10.github.io" class="no-underline hover:cursor-pointer">nitroguy10.github.io</a></h3><div class="grid grid-cols-1 text-xl text-zinc-400 mb-5 sm:grid-cols-2"><div class="col-span-2"><p class="mb-0">11 December 2016 - Ongoing (TODO sunset date hehe)</p><p class="mb-0">Python, HTML, Sass, JavaScript</p><p class="mb-0">Jinja</p></div><!----><!----></div><div class="mb-7"><!--[--><p>Imagine doing web development for over 5 years without touching React or Vue anything like that, right guys?

Though intimidating, I was able to finish this project and I used to consider it my <em>magnum opus</em>. It is VERY cool, trust me.</p><p>...okay so I can&#39;t exactly <em>show</em> it to you but I guess I can describe what it is. So, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/555_timer_IC" rel="noopener noreferrer">555 timer</a> is a chip that can be used to generate a square wave at a given frequency. With the right configuration, you can get it to play a tone on a speaker. My goal for this project was to play music using the tone generated by the 555 timer. The way you&#39;d change the pitch of the tone is by changing the resistance between two of the chip&#39;s pins and I used a digital potentiometer for this.</p><p>As if I hadn&#39;t already had my work cut out for me, knowing hardly anything about Computer Engineering stuff,I wanted to be able to use MIDI files as the source for the music. What all of this ultimately resulted inwas a Java program (probably should&#39;ve used Python though) that read through a MIDI file and translated itinto something that the &quot;music player&quot; Java program could use. This &quot;music player&quot; program (which ran on aRaspberry PI) played the correct notes at the correct times on the 555 timer by sending bytes to the digitalpotentiometer through its GPIO pins.</p><p>And... yeah. It worked. And it was awesome. I really wish I had something else to show you here.

Jumpy is a game I &quot;made&quot; by half following a tutorial and half doing my own thing. I was a rather unexperienced but quickly-learning programmer at the time and I remember being so happy when I made a nested for-loop that read through the 2D arrays that stored the levels. I showed this game to a bunch of people at school and it was so awesome to see them all play it and subsequently rage at how hard it was. To this day I still have the list on my phone that contains the names of the people I knew who beat Jumpy. All 13 of them.</p><p>The game itself is a pretty basic HTML5 canvas web game. It&#39;s a typical 2D platformer with positively asinine level design. The difficulty curve is outta wack. What&#39;s funny is that whenever I found a bug with the physics, instead of fixing it, I designed levels that used that bug. The epitome of &quot;it&#39;s not a bug, it&#39;s a feature&quot;. There&#39;s also a level creator, which is pretty awesome.</p><p>P.S. If you&#39;re one of my friends from school and you came to my website just to look for Jumpy, you found it!
